            <h1>Dedication to Patient Safety</h1>
            <p>Our plastic surgeons are among the most highly 
                qualified in the field, and we have upheld an outstanding 
                record of patient safety. We have 4 on-site operating rooms 
                for local anesthesia cases, which enable us to safely and 
                conveniently perform procedures like mini-facelifts and 
                mini-tummy tucks. We perform more complex, time-consuming 
                procedures requiring general anesthesia – procedures like 
                facelifts, breast surgery, and body contouring – at an 
                outpatient ambulatory surgery center adjacent to our 
                office. It has all the safety features of a hospital, 
                including board-certified anesthesiologists. What it does 
                not have is a constant influx of sick patients or a vast, 
                impersonal atmosphere. We’ve chosen this surgical setting
                for the superior care and safety of our patients, who will 
                receive support from the finest anesthesiologists and 
                nursing personnel in an intimate setting.</p>
